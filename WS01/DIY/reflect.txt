Upon successful completion of this workshop, I have acquired the abilities to organize source code into modules, using header 
and implementation files, compile and link modular programs, distinguish the contents of a header and an implementation file. 
I have learned to use, reuse, and modify source code from one project to another. This workshop has taught me how to write 
modular programs that are easy to maintain, debug, and reuse. I have learned how to use header files to declare the interface 
of a module, and implementation files to define the functionality of a module. I have also learned how to use a compiler and 
a linker to create executable files from multiple source files. Additionally, I have learned how to reuse existing code from 
other projects by copying or including the relevant header and implementation files, and how to modify them to suit my needs. 
Furthermore, I have learned how to avoid duplication of code by using functions, variables, and constants that are defined in 
one module and used in another. I have also learned how to document my code using comments and naming conventions that make it 
easier to understand and modify. I am grateful that I did not encounter any difficulty in completing the workshop. This is a 
rare occurrence in an OOP244 class, which is usually challenging and demanding.
