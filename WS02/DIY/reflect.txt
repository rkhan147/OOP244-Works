This workshop has been instrumental in advancing my programming proficiency, focusing on dynamic memory management, 
function overloading, and reference utilization. The allocation and deallocation of dynamic memory for arrays and 
single objects were explored in-depth, enhancing my ability to efficiently handle memory resources. Function 
overloading was a key concept learned, providing insight into creating adaptable functions for code reusability and 
improved codebase readability. Understanding how to leverage references proved crucial for optimizing code 
performance.

Despite the enriching experience, challenges arose in mastering the intricacies of memory deallocation, emphasizing 
the need for meticulous memory handling to prevent leaks and ensure resource efficiency. The wording of what was
required of me to do also proved challenging as there were many gaps of information that I had to fill myself as I
wrote and tested my code over and over again. Overall, the workshop has significantly bolstered my programming 
skills, empowering me to write more efficient and organized code while highlighting the importance of careful memory 
management in creating robust programs.
