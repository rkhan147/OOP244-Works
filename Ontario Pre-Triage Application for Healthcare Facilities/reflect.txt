Learnings:
Working on the "General Healthcare Facility Pre-Triage Application" project has been an 
enriching experience, particularly in terms of consolidating my understanding of C++ 
object-oriented programming. One of the key learnings was the integration of various 
concepts such as classes, inheritance, and dynamic memory management to create a cohesive 
application. Additionally, implementing the load and save functionalities enhanced my 
understanding of file handling in C++, allowing me to store and retrieve data efficiently.

Challenges:
One of the significant challenges I encountered during the development of the application 
was managing the dynamic memory allocation for the patient lineup. Ensuring proper 
allocation and deallocation of memory while handling various patient types required 
careful attention to avoid memory leaks or segmentation faults. Additionally, 
understanding and implementing the logic for calculating and updating the average wait 
times posed a challenge initially. However, through thorough testing and debugging, I was 
able to overcome these challenges and ensure the correctness and robustness of the application.

Overall, this project provided valuable insights into software development practices, 
including design considerations, implementation strategies, and debugging techniques. It 
not only reinforced my understanding of C++ programming but also equipped me with practical 
skills that are applicable in real-world scenarios. Through this experience, I've gained 
confidence in my ability to tackle complex projects and deliver solutions that meet the 
desired specifications.
