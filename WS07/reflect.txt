Through the completion of this workshop, I have gained a deeper understanding of object-oriented 
programming concepts, particularly in the context of inheritance and polymorphism. The process 
of inheriting a derived class from a base class was instrumental in learning how to extend the 
functionality of existing code without modifying it directly.

One challenge I encountered was shadowing a base class member function with a derived class 
member function. It took some practice to understand how to properly override functions and when 
to use the `override` keyword.

Accessing a shadowed member function defined in a base class was another area that required 
attention. I learned the importance of using the scope resolution operator to specify which 
version of the function I wanted to call.

Implementing custom input/output operators enhanced my understanding of operator overloading and 
how it can be used to streamline the process of reading and writing class instances.

Overall, this workshop has solidified my understanding of these advanced C++ features and has 
prepared me to apply them in future projects. The hands-on experience has been invaluable, and I 
look forward to tackling more complex problems with the knowledge I've acquired.
