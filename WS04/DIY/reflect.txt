Completing this workshop has been quite a journey! I've gained a solid understanding of several key topics in 
object-oriented programming, specifically in C++. First off, I delved into the world of constructors â€“ both default and 
overloaded. Constructors are like the blueprints for initializing objects, and learning how to use them effectively was 
crucial. Overloading constructors opened up a whole new level of flexibility, allowing me to create objects with different 
sets of parameters.

Next up were destructors, the cleanup crew of the class. They handle the deallocation of resources when an object goes out 
of scope, which is essential for preventing memory leaks. Understanding how to properly implement destructors was vital for 
managing dynamic resources allocated during runtime.

One of the most interesting aspects was using the current object within the class's member functions. It's like the class 
is aware of itself and can manipulate its own state. This concept really solidified my understanding of object-oriented 
programming and encapsulation.

Throughout the workshop, I faced some challenges, especially with memory management and understanding the intricacies of 
constructor and destructor interactions. However, with practice and guidance, I was able to overcome these difficulties 
and grasp the concepts effectively. Overall, completing this workshop has equipped me with a strong foundation in C++ OOP, 
and I'm excited to apply these skills to future projects.
