In completing this workshop, I gained a deeper understanding of function templates and their 
practical applications in C++. By implementing the Pair template struct and the accompanying 
functions, I solidified my comprehension of template syntax and usage. Working with templates 
allowed me to create flexible and reusable code that can handle different data types seamlessly, 
enhancing code modularity and scalability.

Moreover, I learned about dynamic memory management in C++ and the importance of properly 
allocating and deallocating memory to prevent memory leaks. Implementing the addDynamicPairElement 
function provided insight into managing dynamic arrays efficiently, ensuring memory is allocated 
correctly to accommodate new elements.

Additionally, collaborating with the provided Book and Student modules expanded my understanding 
of how templates can be integrated into larger projects, emphasizing the importance of code 
organization and modular design.

Throughout the workshop, I encountered challenges such as understanding the intricacies of 
template syntax and debugging issues related to memory management. However, overcoming these 
challenges further solidified my understanding of the concepts covered.

Overall, this workshop enhanced my proficiency in C++ templates, dynamic memory management, 
and reinforced the importance of writing clean, modular, and efficient code.
