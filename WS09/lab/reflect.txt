In completing this workshop, I deepened my understanding of object-oriented programming concepts, 
particularly inheritance and polymorphism. By creating the LibraryItem class and its derived class 
Book, I gained practical experience in applying the rule of three to manage dynamically allocated 
resources properly.

Implementing the constructors, destructor, and assignment operators for both the base and derived 
classes reinforced the importance of memory management and resource cleanup to prevent memory leaks 
and undefined behavior.

Furthermore, working with virtual functions and operator overloading in the display and operator> 
methods of the LibraryItem and Book classes showcased the power of polymorphism and how it enables 
code reuse and extensibility.

Throughout the workshop, I encountered challenges such as understanding the nuances of virtual 
functions and properly implementing the rule of three. However, by carefully reviewing the course 
notes and experimenting with different approaches, I was able to overcome these challenges and 
solidify my understanding of the material.

Overall, this workshop was instrumental in enhancing my proficiency in object-oriented design 
principles and their practical application in C++.
