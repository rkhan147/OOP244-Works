Alright, so after diving deep into this workshop and reviewing my final solutions, along with revisiting the course 
notes, I feel pretty confident about my grasp on the concepts covered. First off, defining class types was a breeze.
I understood how to structure them and encapsulate data within them to ensure privacy. Using member functions to 
both query and modify the state of objects was straightforward, and it's clear to me now how these functions play a 
crucial role in managing the behavior of objects.

Formatting output on the console was another skill I honed during this workshop. I learned various techniques to 
present data in a readable and aesthetically pleasing manner, which is essential when communicating with users or 
other parts of a program. Overall, this workshop has equipped me with a solid understanding of object-oriented 
programming fundamentals, specifically in C++. I can confidently explain to my instructor how I've learned to define
classes, privatize data, utilize member functions effectively, and format output for better user experience. It's 
been a productive learning experience, and I'm excited to apply these skills in future projects.
